# Jasmine Testing for Udacity Feed Reader

## Purpose

This feedreader example provides a demonstration of functional testing using the Jasmine Test Suite model.

## Description

At the bottom of the page, you will find a collection of expectations for proper execution of the RSS Feedreader.  Each expectation has been automatically tested against the page execution.  If the page performs as expected, the test passes and is 'green'.  If the page does not perform as expected, the test fails and is 'red'.  The Jasmine test suite shows that all expectations have been met for proper function and display of this page.
